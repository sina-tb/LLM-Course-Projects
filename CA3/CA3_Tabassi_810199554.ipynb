        "**The Tree-of-Thought:** ToT methodology in reasoning tasks involves systematically branching out from initial prompts or questions, akin to the growth of a tree, to explore various lines of thought and potential conclusions. This approach encompasses a structured framework where each step in the thought process leads to further elaboration or refinement, allowing for comprehensive examination and analysis of the underlying concepts or problems. By delineating the progression of thoughts into distinct branches, the ToT method facilitates a more organized and thorough exploration of reasoning pathways, ultimately aiding in the generation of well-founded conclusions or solutions.\n",

        "**Self-Consistency:**denotes the coherence and logical integrity maintained throughout the sequence of connected ideas or steps. Within this approach, each subsequent thought or conclusion is built upon the foundation laid by preceding ones, ensuring a seamless progression of reasoning. By adhering to principles of internal consistency, where each step aligns with and supports the overarching line of reasoning, the CoT method fosters robust and dependable chains of thought. This commitment to self-consistency enhances the reliability and persuasiveness of the argumentation or problem-solving process, contributing to more cogent and defensible outcomes in reasoning tasks. Moreover, CoT-SC involves sampling independent chains of thought and then selecting the most frequent output, further reinforcing the coherence and reliability of the reasoning process by integrating diverse perspectives and ensuring consensus in the final output."

        "We propose a better approach in language model (LLM) that incorporates several advanced features aimed at enhancing its reasoning capabilities. These include the integration of Chain of Thoughts (CoT) for facilitating coherent reasoning processes, the implementation of Self Consistency to ensure logical coherence in generated outputs, and the adoption of a zero-temperature setting to maximize confidence in predictions. Additionally, the model introduces a role-playing mechanism to enhance task diversity, allowing it to adapt its reasoning strategies based on contextual cues provided by designated roles. For instance, when tasked with generating mathematics questions, the model can be guided by a designated role, such as a mathematics teacher, to tailor its responses accordingly. This comprehensive approach empowers the model to reason more effectively across various tasks and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "the main features of this models are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- CoT enables the model to maintain a coherent flow of reasoning across multiple steps or iterations. Instead of generating responses in isolation, the model can generate a sequence of interconnected thoughts or actions, mimicking human-like reasoning processes. This allows the model to reason through complex scenarios more effectively and generate more coherent and contextually relevant outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Self Consistency ensures that the model's generated outputs are internally consistent and logically coherent. By enforcing self-consistency constraints during generation, the model can avoid generating contradictory or nonsensical responses. This improves the overall quality and reliability of the model's outputs, enhancing its reasoning abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Setting the temperature of the model to zero essentially means maximizing the confidence of its predictions. Instead of generating probabilistic outputs, the model produces deterministic outputs with high confidence levels. This enables the model to make more confident and assertive predictions, which is particularly useful in tasks where precision and accuracy are crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Role-playing provides the model with contextual cues or personas to adapt its behavior and reasoning strategies based on the specific task at hand. For example, if the model is tasked with generating mathematics questions, providing it with a \"mathematics teacher\" role-play prompt informs the model about the context and expectations of the task. This helps the model tailor its responses and reasoning approaches to suit the given role or scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of this model and how it enhances LLM's reasoning abilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Enhanced Coherence:** By incorporating CoT and self-consistency, the model can produce more coherent and logically consistent outputs, improving its overall reasoning abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increased Confidence:** Zero temperature ensures that the model's predictions are made with high confidence levels, reducing uncertainty and improving the reliability of its reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Task Adaptability:** Role-playing enables the model to adapt its reasoning strategies based on the specific task or context, allowing for greater flexibility and versatility in its responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Improved Generalization:** The combination of these features enables the model to generalize its reasoning abilities across a wide range of tasks and scenarios, making it more robust and capable of handling diverse challenges.\n",

            "Passage: Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned.  King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody.  However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including that of corporate officers of retail chains with stores in downtown Birmingham. After King's arrest, the chains' profits began to erode. National business owners pressed the Kennedy administration to intervene. King was released on April 20, 1963.\n",

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids.\n",

She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape.\n",

Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat. Selene deliberately slides herself under the now broken ice of the lake, telling herself that this is the 'path'.\n",

Stephen awakens to the chaos of the Duncan household as Coffee Cup practices his wrestling technique on Pigeon, Mrs. Duncan delivers a neighbor's baby and Ivory, a sailor, tinkles the piano keys. Stephen is so delighted by Dot's boisterous family and friends that he accompanies her and Coffee Cup to a dance hall and congas the night away, forgetting all about his date with the snobbish Cecilia.\n",

            "Passage: There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and Vytenis' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the Hypatian Codex and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions Daumantas as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of Tver and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.\n",
            "The Gediminid dynasty began its ascent in Lithuania during this time with the emergence of its first leader, Butigeidis. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked Sambia. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day Sovetsk (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the Neman River. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother Butvydas (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of Vytenis and probably of Gediminas. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked Masovia, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point at which it was poised for expansion.\n",

            "Passage: Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century.\n",
            "From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records.\n",
            "Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death.\n",

            "Passage: Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m), pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.\n",

            "Passage: The Annunciation draws heavily on van der Weyden's 1430s Louvre Annunciation, his c. 1455  Saint Columba altarpiece, and the Clugny Annunciation (c. 1465–75), which is attributed to either van der Weyden or Memling. Memling almost certainly was apprenticed to van der Weyden in Brussels until setting up his own workshop in Bruges sometime after 1465. Memling's Annunciation is more innovative, with motifs such as the attendant angels that were absent in the earlier paintings. According to Till-Holger Borchert, not only was Memling familiar with van der Weyden's motifs and compositions, but he might have assisted with the underdrawing in van der Weyden's workshop. The shutters on the right are copied from the Louvre panel, the knotted curtain appears in the Columba triptych's \"Annunciation\".A sense of movement is conveyed throughout. The trailing edges of Gabriel's garment fall outside the pictorial space, indicating his arrival. The Virgin's \"serpentine\" pose, with attendant angels supporting her, adds to the sense of flow. Memling's use of color achieves a startling effect. The traditional rays of light are replaced with light color indicators; the white clothes rendered in \"icy\" blue, the angel to the right in yellow patches seems \"bleached by light\", the left-hand angel appears to be steeped in shadow, dressed in clothes of lavender and bearing deep green wings. The effect is iridescent, according to Blum, who writes, \"this shimmering surface gives [the figures] an unearthly quality, separating them from the more believable world of the bedchamber.\" The effect deviates from the pure naturalism and realism which typifies Early Netherlandish art, causing a \"startling\" juxtaposition, an effect that is \"unsteadying\" and contradictory.\n",

            "Passage: From 1837, Alkan lived in the Square d'Orléans in Paris, which was inhabited by numerous celebrities of the time including Marie Taglioni, Alexandre Dumas, George Sand, and Chopin. Chopin and Alkan were personal friends and often discussed musical topics, including a work on musical theory that Chopin proposed to write. By 1838, at 25 years old, Alkan had reached a peak of his career. He frequently gave recitals, his more mature works had begun to be published, and he often appeared in concerts with Liszt and Chopin. On 23 April 1837 Alkan took part in Liszt's farewell concert in Paris, together with the 14-year-old César Franck and the virtuoso Johann Peter Pixis. On 3 March 1838, at a concert at the piano-maker Pape, Alkan played with Chopin, Zimmerman, and Chopin's pupil Adolphe Gutmann in a performance of Alkan's transcription, now lost, of two movements of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony for two pianos, eight hands.At this point, for a period which coincided with the birth and childhood of his natural son, Élie-Miriam Delaborde (1839–1913), Alkan withdrew into private study and composition for six years, returning to the concert platform only in 1844.  Alkan neither asserted nor denied his paternity of Delaborde, which, however, his contemporaries seemed to assume. Marmontel wrote cryptically in a biography of Delaborde that \"[his] birth is a page from a novel in the life of a great artist\". Alkan gave early piano lessons to Delaborde, who was to follow his natural father as a keyboard virtuoso.Alkan's return to the concert platform in 1844 was greeted with enthusiasm by critics, who noted the \"admirable perfection\" of his technique, and lauded him as \"a model of science and inspiration\", a \"sensation\" and an \"explosion\". They also commented on the attending celebrities including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. In the same year he published his piano étude Le chemin de fer, which critics, following Ronald Smith, believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine. Between 1844 and 1848 Alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces, the 25 Préludes Op. 31 for piano or organ, and the sonata Op. 33 Les quatre âges. Following an Alkan recital in 1848, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer was so impressed that he invited the pianist, whom he considered \"a most remarkable artist\", to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera, Le prophète. Meyerbeer heard and approved Alkan's arrangement of the overture for four hands (which Alkan played with his brother Napoléon) in 1849; published in 1850, it is the only record of the overture, which was scrapped during rehearsals at the Opéra.\n",

Unlike the Transformers library, which primarily focuses on providing pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing tasks, GGUF serves as a standardized format for input and output across various language generation tasks. By standardizing the input format, GGUF simplifies the integration of different models and enables smoother transitions between tasks, facilitating seamless model chaining and ensemble methods. Additionally, GGUF promotes model interpretability and reproducibility by establishing clear guidelines for input data formatting and output generation, thereby fostering collaboration and innovation within the research community."

Gonzalez\\ntianjunz@berkeley.edu, shishirpatil@berkeley.edu\\nUC Berkeley\\nAbstract\\nPretraining Large Language Models (LLMs) on\\nlarge corpora of textual data is now a standard\\nparadigm. When using these LLMs for many\\ndownstream applications, it is common to ad-\\nditionally bake in new knowledge (e.g., time-\\ncritical news, or private domain knowledge) into\\nthe pretrained model either through RAG-based-\\nprompting, or finetuning. However, the optimal\\nmethodology for the model to gain such new\\nknowledge remains an open question. In this pa-\\nper, we present Retrieval Augmented Fine Tun-\\ning (RAFT), a training recipe that improves the\\nmodel’s ability to answer questions in an \"open-\\nbook\" in-domain setting. In RAFT, given a ques-\\ntion, and a set of retrieved documents, we train\\nthe model to ignore those documents that don’t\\nhelp in answering the question, which we call,\\ndistractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this\\nby citing verbatim the right sequence from the rel-\\nevant document that would help answer the ques-\\ntion. This coupled with RAFT’s chain-of-thought-\\nstyle response helps improve the model’s ability\\nto reason. In domain specific RAG, RAFT consis-\\ntently improves the model’s performance across\\nPubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla datasets, present-\\ning a post-training recipe to improve pre-trained\\nLLMs to in-domain RAG. RAFT’s code and demo\\nare open-sourced at https://github.com/\\nShishirPatil/gorilla\\n1. Introduction\\nTrained on vast quantities of public data, Large Language\\nModels LLMs have achieved significant advances in a wide\\nrange of general knowledge reasoning tasks (Brown et al.,\\n2020; Wei et al., 2022).\\nHowever, increasingly LLMs are being employed in special-\\nized domains to support tasks ranging from code completion\\nfor specific software frameworks to question answering on\\nspecific document collections (e.g., legal or medical docu-\\nments). In these settings, general knowledge reasoning is\\nless critical but instead, the primary goal is to maximize ac-\\ncuracy based on a given set of documents. Indeed, adapting\\nLLMs to the specialized domains (e.g., recent news, enter-\\nprise private documents, or program resources constructed\\nafter the training cutoff) is essential to many emerging ap-\\nplications (Vu et al., 2023; Lazaridou et al., 2022) and is the\\nfocus of this work.\\nThis paper studies the following question – How to adapt\\npre-trained LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) in specialized domains?\\nWhen it comes to adapting LLMs to specialized domains,\\nwe consider the following two candidates: in-context learn-\\ning through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and\\nsupervised fine-tuning. RAG-based methods allow the LLM\\nto reference the documents when answering questions. How-\\never, these methods fail to leverage the learning opportunity\\nafforded by the fixed domain setting and early access to\\nthe test documents. Alternatively, supervised fine-tuning\\noffers the opportunity to learn more general patterns in the\\ndocuments and better align to end tasks and user prefer-\\nences (Zhou et al., 2023a). However, existing fine-tuning\\nbased approaches either fail to leverage the documents at\\ntest time (don’t incorporate RAG) or fail to account for the\\nimperfections in the retrieval process during training.\\nWe can draw an analogy to an open-book exam. Exist-\\ning in-context retrieval methods are equivalent to taking an\\nopen-book exam without studying. Alternatively, existing\\nfine-tuning based approaches implement “studying\" by ei-\\nther directly “memorizing\" (Xiong et al., 2023) the input\\ndocuments or answering practice questions (Wang et al.,\\n2022) without referencing the documents. While these ap-\\nproaches leverage in-domain learning they fail to prepare\\nfor the open-book nature of test setting.\\nIn this paper, we study how to combine supervised\\nfine-tuning (SFT) with retrieval augmented generation\\n(RAG). We propose a novel adaptation strategy – Retrieval-\\nAugmented Fine Tuning (RAFT). RAFT specifically ad-\\ndresses the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs to incorporate\\ndomain knowledge while also improving in-domain RAG\\n1\\narXiv:2403.10131v1  [cs.CL]  15 Mar 2024\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\n“Open book”\\nquery\\nanswer\\n“Closed book”\\nquery\\nanswer\\nBake in Knowledge \\nat Train Time\\nModel can use \\nExternal Docs at Test\\nRAFT (Proposed)\\nquery\\nanswer\\nTeach Model to\\n use External Docs at Test\\nFigure 1: How best to prepare for an Exam?(a) Fine-tuning based approaches implement \"studying\" by either directly\\n\"memorizing\" the input documents or answering practice QA without referencing the documents. (b) Alternatively, in-\\ncontext retrieval methods fail to leverage the learning opportunity afforded by the fixed domain and are equivalent to\\ntaking an open-book exam without studying. While these approaches leverage in-domain learning, they fail to prepare for\\nopen-book tests. In contrast, our approach (c) RAFT leverages fine-tuning with question-answer pairs while referencing the\\ndocuments in a simulated imperfect retrieval setting — thereby effectively preparing for the open-book exam setting.\\nperformance. RAFT aims to not only enable models to learn\\ndomain specific knowledge through fine-tuning, but also\\nto ensure robustness against inaccurate retrievals. This is\\nachieved by training the models to understand the dynamics\\nbetween the question posed (prompt), the domain specific\\ndocuments retrieved, and the appropriate answer. Going\\nback to our analogy, our approach is analogous to study-\\ning for an open-book exam by recognizing relevant, and\\nirrelevant retrieved documents.\\nIn RAFT, we train the model to answer the question (Q)\\nfrom Document(s) (D*) to generate an answer (A*), where\\nA* includes chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022; Anthropic,\\n2023), and in the presence of distractor documents (Dk).\\nWe explain the methodology in detail in Section 3 and ana-\\nlyze the sensitivity to the number of distractor documents\\n(k) at train- and test- time in Section 5. RAFT consis-\\ntently outperforms Supervised-finetuning both with- and\\nwithout- RAG across PubMed (Dernoncourt & Lee, 2017),\\nHotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), and HuggingFace Hub, Torch\\nHub, and Tensorflow Hub Gorilla datasets (Patil et al., 2023),\\npresenting a novel, yet simple technique to improve pre-\\ntrained LLMs for in-domain RAG.\\n2. LLMs for Open-Book Exam\\nTo understand our goal better, we expand on our analogy be-\\ntween training an LLM in the real-world setting of preparing\\nfor an exam.\\nClosed-Book Exam\\nA closed book exam often refers to\\na scenario where the LLMs do not have access to any ad-\\nditional documents or references to answer the questions\\nduring the exam. For LLMs, this is equivalent to the sce-\\nnario, for example, in which the LLM is used as a chatbot.\\nIn this scenario, the LLM draws from the knowledge baked\\nin during pre-training and supervised finetuning to respond\\nto the prompt.\\nOpen Book Exam\\nIn contrast, we liken the open-book\\nexam setting to the scenario in which the LLM can re-\\nfer to external sources of information (e.g., a website or\\na book chapter). In such scenarios, typically, the LLM is\\npaired with a retriever which retrieves ‘k’ documents (or\\nspecific segments of the document) which are appended to\\nthe prompt. It is only through these documents retrieved that\\nthe LLM gains access to “new knowledge”. As a result, we\\nargue that the LLM’s performance in these settings, where it\\nis trained as a general-purpose LLM is largely dependent on\\nthe quality of the retriever and how accurately the retriever\\ncan identify the most relevant piece of information.\\nDomain Specific Open-Book Exam\\nIn this paper, we\\nfocused on a narrower but increasingly popular domain than\\nthe general open book exam, called the domain specific\\nopen book exam. In domain specific open book exams, we\\nknow apriori the domain in which the LLM will be tested\\n– used for inference. The LLM can respond to the prompt\\nusing use any and all information from this specific domain,\\nwhich it has been fine-tuned on. Examples of domain spe-\\ncific examples include enterprise documents, latest news,\\ncode repositories belonging to an organization, etc. In all\\nthese scenarios, the LLM will be used to respond to the\\nquestions, whose answers can be found within a collection\\nof documents (a small practical domain). The retrieval tech-\\nnique itself has little to no impact on the mechanism (though\\nit may impact the accuracy). This paper mainly studies this,\\ndomain specific open-book setting and how to adapt a pre-\\ntrained LLM to this specific domain, including how to make\\nit more robust to a varying number of retrieved documents\\nand distractors.\\n3. RAFT\\nIn this section, we present RAFT, a novel way of training\\nLLMs for domain specific open-book exams. We first intro-\\nduce the classical technique of supervised fine-tuning, fol-\\n2\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\nFigure 2: Overview of our RAFT method. The top-left figure depicts our approach of adapting LLMs to reading solution\\nfrom a set of positive and negative documents in contrast to standard RAG setup where models are trained based on the\\nretriever outputs, which is a mixture of both memorization and reading. At test time, all methods follow the standard RAG\\nsetting, provided with a top-k retrieved documents in the context.\\nlowed by the key takeaways from our experiments. Then, we\\nintroduce RAFT , a modified version of general instruction\\ntuning. Lastly, we provide an overview of the experiments\\nto expect in the later sections.\\nSupervised Finetuning\\nConsider the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting for a\\nQuestion-Answer dataset. The formulation consists of the\\nDataset (D) from which a set of Question (Q) and corre-\\nsponding answer (A) pairs are derived or already available.\\nIn the classical SFT setting, the model is trained to improve\\nits ability to answer the questions based on its knowledge -\\nobtained either during pre-training, or during the SFT train-\\ning phase. The model so trained can also be used at test-time\\nwith the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) setting,\\nwhere additional documents can be introduced in the prompt\\nto help the model answer the question. This can be repre-\\nsented as follows:\\n• Train: Q →A\\n• 0-shot Inference: Q →A\\n• RAG Inference: Q + D →A\\nRAFT\\nRetrieval Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT), presents a novel\\nrecipe to prepare fine-tuning data to tailor the models for\\ndomain specific open-book settings, equivalent to in-domain\\nRAG In RAFT, we prepare the training data such that each\\ndata point contains a question (Q), a set of documents (Dk),\\nand a corresponding Chain-of-though style answer (A∗)\\ngenerated from one of the document (D∗). We differentiate\\nbetween two types of documents: ‘oracle’ documents (D∗)\\ni.e. the documents from which the answer to the question\\ncan be deduced, and ‘distractor’ documents (Di) that do not\\ncontain answer-relevant information. As an implementation\\ndetail, the ‘oracle’ document doesn’t need to be a single doc-\\nument, but can be more than one document, as is the case in\\nHotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018). Then, for P fraction of the\\nquestions (qi) in the dataset, we retain the oracle document\\n(d∗\\ni ) along with distractor documents (dk−1). For (1 −P)\\nfraction of the questions (qi) in the dataset, we include no\\noracle document and only include distractor documents (dk).\\nWe then fine-tune the language model using the standard\\nsupervised training (SFT) technique, training it to generate\\nanswers from the provided documents and questions. Fig. 2\\nillustrates the high-level design principal for RAFT .\\nWe demonstrate that our approach trains the model to per-\\nform better RAG on the set of documents it is trained on i.e.,\\nin-domain. By removing the oracle documents in some in-\\nstances, we are compelling the model to memorize answers\\ninstead of deriving them from the context. The training data\\nfor RAFT is as follows, and an example of training data can\\nbe seen in Fig. 3:\\n• P % of data: Q + D∗+ D2 + . . . + Dk →A∗\\n• (1 −P) % of data: Q + D1 + D2 + . . . + Dk →A∗\\nSubsequently, for the test scenario, the model is provided\\nwith the Q and top-k documents retrieved by the RAG\\npipeline. Note that RAFT is independent of the retriever\\nused.\\nA key factor in enhancing training quality is the genera-\\n3\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\ntion of a reasoning process, such as Chain-of-Thought, to\\nexplain the provided answers.RAFT approach is similar:\\nwe demonstrate that creating a full reasoning chain and in\\naddition, clearly citing sources enhances the model’s accu-\\nracy in answering questions. In Fig. 3, we illustrate this\\nset-up. Generating the training data in this fashion, involves\\npresenting the model with a question, context, and verified\\nanswers, and then requesting it to form a reasoning chain\\nthat appropriately references the original context.\\nFor all the datasets in our experiments, we generate the\\nanswers using the technique described above. Note that the\\nGorilla APIBench dataset, already includes reasoning in\\nthe answers. We provide an example of the generation step\\nin Fig. 3, the detailed reasoning answer includes a citation\\nfrom the original context inside ##begin_quote## and\\n##end_quote## as well as the detailed explanation on\\nhow to reach the conclusion based on the citations. We\\ndemonstrate that adding detailed reasoning paragraphs helps\\nboost the model’s performance in our experiment section.\\n4. Evaluation\\nWe design our experiments to study how well RAFT per-\\nforms compared to various baselines. We find that the RAFT-\\n7B model (a finetuned version of LlaMA-2) is better at read-\\ning and extracting information from in-domain documents,\\nthan domain specific finetuned model, and general-purpose\\nmodel with RAG. As an ablation, we also demonstrate how\\nimportant it is for the model to learn with Chain-of-Thought\\nresponses. In this section, we will first introduce all the\\ndatasets we used in the experiments, then all the baseline\\nmodel/fine-tuning techniques that we benchmark against.\\n4.1. Datasets\\nIn our experiments, we use the following datasets to evaluate\\nour model and all baselines. We selected these datasets\\nto represent both popular and diverse domains including\\nWikipedia, Coding/API documents, and question-answering\\non medical documents.\\n• Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019),\\nTrivia QA (Joshi et al., 2017) and HotpotQA (Yang\\net al., 2018) are the open-domain question-answers\\nbased on Wikipedia, mainly focused on common\\nknowledge (e.g., movies, sports, etc).\\n• HuggingFace, Torch Hub, and TensorFlow Hub are\\nfrom the APIBench (Patil et al., 2023) proposed in\\nthe Gorilla paper. These benchmarks measure how to\\ngenerate the correct, functional, and executable API\\ncalls based on the documentation.\\n• PubMed QA (Jin et al., 2019) is a question-answering\\ndataset tailored only for biomedical-research question-\\nanswering. It mainly focuses on answering medical\\nand biology questions based on a given set of docu-\\nments.\\nNote that the first category of dataset (NQ, Trivia QA, and\\nHotpotQA) is a relatively general domain whereas the latter\\ntwo domains are on very domain specific documents.\\nBaselines\\nWe consider the following baselines for our\\nexperiments:\\n• LlaMA2-7B-chat model with 0-shot prompting: this is\\nthe commonly used instruction-finetuned model for QA\\ntasks, where we provide clearly written instructions,\\nbut no reference documentation.\\n• LlaMA2-7B-chat model with RAG (Llama2 + RAG):\\nsimilar to the previous setting, except here we include\\nreference documents. This is a popular technique when\\ndealing with domain specific QA tasks.\\n• domain specific Finetuning with 0-shot prompting\\n(DSF): Performing standard supervised finetuning,\\nwithout documents in context. We find that it mostly\\nuseful to align the answering style of the model as well\\nas get familiar with the domain context.\\n• domain specific Finetuning with RAG (DSF + RAG):\\nEquip a domain specific finetuned model with external\\nknowledge using RAG. So, for the “knowledge” the\\nmodel does not know, it can still refer to the context.\\n4.2. Results\\nUsing the above datasets and baselines, we evaluate our\\nmodel RAFT and demonstrate the effectiveness of RAFT in\\nTab. 1. We see that RAFT consistently and significantly\\noutperforms the baselines. Compared with the base Llama-\\n2 instruction-tuned model, RAFT with RAG does much\\nbetter in terms of extracting information as well as being\\nrobust towards distractors. The gain can be as big as 35.25%\\non Hotpot QA and 76.35% on Torch Hub evaluation. Com-\\npared with DSF on the specific dataset, our model does bet-\\nter at relying on the provided context to solve the problem.\\nRAFT does much better on tasks like HotpotQA and Hug-\\ngingFace datasets (30.87% on HotpotQA and 31.41% on\\nHuggingFace). Note that for PubMed QA, since it is a binary\\nyes/no question, we don’t observe significant gains when we\\ncompare our model with DSF + RAG. Even compared with\\na much larger and better model GPT-3.5, RAFT demon-\\nstrates significant advantages.\\nOverall, the LLaMA-7B model, both with and without the\\nRAG, performs poorly due to its answering style not align-\\ning with the ground truth.

We compare our model with LLaMA finetuning receipes, and provide\\nGPT-3.5 for reference.\\nPubMed\\nHotpotQA\\nHuggingFace\\nTorch Hub\\nTensorFlow Hub\\nGPT-3.5 + RAG\\n71.60\\n41.5\\n29.08\\n60.21\\n65.59\\nLLaMA2-7B\\n56.5\\n0.54\\n0.22\\n0\\n0\\nLLaMA2-7B + RAG\\n58.8\\n0.03\\n26.43\\n08.60\\n43.06\\nDSF\\n59.7\\n6.38\\n61.06\\n84.94\\n86.56\\nDSF + RAG\\n71.6\\n4.41\\n42.59\\n82.80\\n60.29\\nRAFT (LLaMA2-7B)\\n73.30\\n35.28\\n74.00\\n84.95\\n86.86\\ntuning, we significantly enhance its performance. This pro-\\ncess enables the model to learn and adopt the appropriate\\nstyle of answering. However, introducing RAG to a domain-\\nspecifically fine-tuned (DSF) model doesn’t invariably lead\\nto better outcomes. This might indicate that the model lacks\\ntraining in context processing and extracting useful infor-\\nmation from it. By incorporating our method, RAFT , we\\ntrain the model not only to match its answering style with\\nthat required but also to improve its document processing\\ncapabilities. Consequently, our approach outperforms all\\nothers.\\n4.3. Effect of CoT\\nWe also conduct an analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of\\nthe Chain-of-Thought approach in enhancing the model’s\\nperformance. As indicated in Table 2, simply providing\\nthe answer to a question may not always be adequate. This\\napproach can lead to a rapid decrease in loss, resulting in\\nthe training process to diverge. Incorporating a reasoning\\nchain that not only guides the model to the answer but also\\nenriches the model’s understanding can improve the over-\\nall accuracy. In our experiments, integrating the Chain-of-\\nThought significantly enhances training robustness. We em-\\nploy GPT-4-1106 to generate our Chain-of-Thought prompts\\n5\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\nand include an example of the prompt we used in Figure 3.\\n4.4. Qualitative Analysis\\nTo illustrate the potential advantages of RAFT over the\\ndomain-specifically fine-tuned (DSF) approach, we present\\na comparative example in Figure 4. This example qual-\\nitatively demonstrates a scenario where the DSF model\\nbecomes confused by a question asking for the identity of\\na screenwriter. Instead of providing the correct name, it\\nmistakenly cites one of the films written by the screenwriter.\\nIn contrast, the RAFT model accurately answers the ques-\\ntion. This discrepancy suggests that training a model solely\\nwith question-answer pairs may impair its ability to derive\\nrelevant context from provided documents. The comparison\\nunderscores the importance of incorporating both standard\\ninstructional tuning and context comprehension into the\\ntraining dataset to preserve and enhance the model’s ability\\nto process text effectively.\\n4.5. Should we train the LLM always with the oracle\\ncontext for RAG?\\nIn our exploration of whether large language models\\n(LLMs) should always be trained with the oracle context for\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we address a key\\nquestion: what proportion (p%) of the training data should\\ninclude oracle documents? Intuitively, one might assume\\nthat for effective training in reading and extracting informa-\\ntion from context (e.g., RAG tasks), the oracle document\\nshould always be included during training (P = 100%). How-\\never, our findings challenge this assumption: incorporating\\na portion of the training data without the oracle document\\nin the context (P = 80%) appears to enhance the model’s\\nperformance on RAG tasks.\\nFig. 5 presents our investigation into the hyperparameter\\nP%, which represents the percentage of training instances\\nthat should include oracle documents. Our analysis reveals\\nthat the optimal proportion varies across datasets, with fig-\\nures ranging from 40%, 60%, and 100%. This indicates\\nthat training your LLM without the correct corresponding\\ncontext at times can be beneficial for the downstream task of\\nanswering questions related to the documents. In our train-\\ning setup, we include four distractor documents alongside\\nthe oracle document, and at test time, we maintain this for-\\nmat by providing the oracle document with four distractors.\\nOur findings suggest that, for domain specific RAG tasks,\\nincluding a certain percentage of training data without the\\noracle documents in the context proves to be advantageous.\\n5. RAFT Generalizes to Top-K RAG\\nAfter demonstrating the performance of RAFT on vari-\\nous benchmarks, we now study another important problem:\\nHow does the number of distractor documents in RAFT af-\\nfect the model’s performance when augmented with top-k\\nretriever augmented generation (RAG) result during the eval-\\nuation? Previous research has highlighted the vulnerability\\nof LLMs to irrelevant text (see studies (Shi et al., 2023a;\\nWeston & Sukhbaatar, 2023; Liu et al., 2023b)). This issue\\nis particularly critical for LLMs + RAG since top-k RAG\\nis frequently employed at test time to ensure high recall.\\nSuch a scenario necessitates the model to have the ability to\\ndiscern and disregard irrelevant content, focusing solely on\\npertinent information.\\n5.1. Making Model Robust to top-K RAG\\nTo tackle the challenge of enhancing large language mod-\\nels’ (LLMs) ability to sift through irrelevant text within the\\nretrieval pipeline, our analysis revealed that training solely\\nwith oracle (highly relevant) documents can inadvertently di-\\nminish the model’s ability to discern and disregard irrelevant\\ninformation. To address this, our algorithm, RAFT , adopts\\na strategy that integrates oracle documents with a mix of\\nirrelevant ones. This methodology prompts us to investigate\\nthe ideal fraction of negative (irrelevant) documents to in-\\ncorporate throughout the training process and to assess how\\nwell this training approach adapts to different volumes of\\ndocuments encountered by the Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration (RAG) during the test phase. Our aim is to refine\\nthe balance between relevant and irrelevant information to\\nstrengthen the model’s efficiency in identifying and utilizing\\npertinent content. Notice that Sec 4.5 looked at what P% of\\ntraining data should include distractors, while in this section,\\nwe study test-time scenarios.\\nTraining with Negative Documents To enhance the robust-\\nness of large language models (LLMs) against irrelevant\\ntext in retrieved documents, we adopted a finetuning ap-\\nproach that incorporates both golden (highly relevant) docu-\\nments and distractor (irrelevant) documents. The model was\\ntrained with varying numbers of distractor documents, but\\nconsistently evaluated using the top-k documents obtained\\nfrom the retriever - not to be confused with p.\\nOur findings, detailed in Fig. 6, reveal that finetuning with\\nonly the oracle document frequently results in inferior per-\\nformance compared to configurations that include a greater\\nnumber of distractor documents. As we can see in the fig-\\nure, the better performance for Natural Questions is training\\nwith D∗+ 3D and it is D∗+ 1D documents with Hotpot\\nQA. This insight has been particularly beneficial for our\\nalgorithm, RAFT . In our experiments, we typically employ\\na training setup consisting of one oracle document alongside\\nfour distractor documents. This approach strikes a balance,\\nensuring the model is not overwhelmed by distractors while\\nstill gaining the ability to effectively discern and prioritize\\nrelevant information.\\n6\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\nTable 2: Ablation on Chain-of-Thought: The numbers of RAFT and RAFT without CoT.

Related Works\\nRetrieval-Augmented Language Models RAG enhances\\nlanguage models by integrating a retrieval module that\\nsources relevant information from external knowledge bases,\\nsignificantly improving performance across various NLP\\ntasks, including language modeling (Guu et al., 2020;\\nBorgeaud et al., 2022; Khandelwal et al., 2019; Shi et al.,\\n2023d; Lin et al., 2023b; Shi et al., 2023c; Asai et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023) and open-domain ques-\\ntion answering (Izacard et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020). This\\nintegration follows a “retrieve-and-read\" paradigm where\\nthe retrieval module provides additional context from exter-\\nnal sources, which the LM then uses to generate the final out-\\nput. The retrieval process involves using the input as a query\\nto fetch documents, which the LM incorporates for final pre-\\ndictions. For instance, Atlas (Izacard et al., 2023) fine-tunes\\nT5 models with the retriever, treating documents as latent\\nvariables, while RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022) modifies\\nthe decoder-only architecture to include retrieved texts and\\nconducts pre-training from scratch. kNN-LM (Khandelwal\\net al., 2019) interpolates between the LM’s next token distri-\\nbution and distributions computed from retrieved tokens at\\ninference.

However, across both datasets, training with all datasets consisting of oracle\\ndocuments hurts performance.\\n2020; Power et al., 2022) or simply rely on surface pattern\\nmemorization (Carlini et al., 2019; Tänzer et al., 2022).\\n(Feldman, 2020; Carlini et al., 2019; 2022) develop method-\\nologies to quantify the extent of memorization in neural\\nmodels. (Brown et al., 2020; Power et al., 2022; Liu et al.,\\n2022b) further explored how memorization impacts the mod-\\nels’ generalization capabilities. Recently, a seminal work\\nby (Carlini et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2023b) demonstrated\\nthe ability of language models to memorize and regurgitate\\ntraining data, raising significant privacy concerns (Kandpal\\net al., 2022; Pan et al., 2020).\\nFinetuning of LLMs Recent years have seen rapid progress\\nin developing large-scale language models (LLMs) (Brown\\net al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; Workshop et al., 2022; Tou-\\nvron et al., 2023;?; Anil et al., 2023). To adapt these foun-\\ndation models to downstream tasks, fine-tuning (Mishra\\net al., 2021; Sanh et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022; Muen-\\nnighoff et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023b; Lin et al., 2023b;\\nJi et al., 2024) has become a prevalent approach. Tradi-\\ntional supervised fine-tuning may be limited by the cost\\nand compute required for adapating LLMs. Addressing\\nthese challenges, research in the realm of parameter-efficient\\nfine-tuning (Houlsby et al., 2019), such as Prompt Tuning\\n(Lester et al., 2021), Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang, 2021),\\nP-Tuning (Liu et al., 2022a) and Low-Rank based fine-\\ntuning (Hu et al., 2021), has gained traction. These methods\\nenable LLMs to acquire domain-specific knowledge and\\nadapt to specialized tasks such as question answering, sum-\\nmarization, and dialogue generation. Another branch of\\nfinetuning is through RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022; Rafailov\\net al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Zhang et al., 2023), which\\nadopts RL to align LLM’s preference with human.\\nFinetuning for RAG More recently, several papers have\\nbeen exploring the idea of finetuning a pretrained LLM to\\nbe better at RAG tasks (Lin et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023;\\nXu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024). These works focus on con-\\nstructing a combination of finetuning dataset for RAG and\\ntrain a model to perform well on these tasks. In particular, in\\n8\\nRAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG\\ntheir settings, at test time, the domain or documents can be\\ndifferent than the training time; whereas our paper studies a\\nslightly opposite scenario where we only care about testing\\nthe LLM on the same set of documents.\\n7. Conclusion\\nRAFT is a training strategy designed to enhance the model’s\\nperformance in answering questions within a specific do-\\nmain, in \"open-book\" settings. This technique demonstrates\\na fine-tuning recipe for LLMs for question-answering tasks\\nbased on a selected collection of documents. We have pin-\\npointed several crucial design decisions, such as training\\nthe model alongside distractor documents, organizing the\\ndataset so a portion lacks oracle documents in their con-\\ntext, and formulating answers in a chain-of-thought manner\\nwith direct quotations from the relevant text. Our evalua-\\ntions on PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla API Bench un-\\nderline RAFT’s significant potential. Looking forward, we\\nanticipate that in-domain Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) will continue to gain interest within both industrial\\nand academic spheres. Unlike general-RAG, our work ad-\\ndresses practical scenarios where LLMs are tasked with an-\\nswering questions using domain-specific knowledge. Align-\\ning with current trends, our findings suggest that smaller,\\nfine-tuned models are capable of performing comparably\\nwell in domain-specific question-answering tasks, in con-\\ntrast to their generic LLM counterparts.\\nReferences\\nAnil, R., Dai, A.

We\\nimplement this program using the DSPy pro-\\ngramming model, which specifies in-context\\nsystems in a declarative manner, and use DSPy\\noptimizers to tune it towards specific datasets\\nby bootstrapping only tens of few-shot exam-\\nples. Our primary extreme classification pro-\\ngram, optimized separately for each task, at-\\ntains state-of-the-art results across three bench-\\nmarks (HOUSE, TECH, TECHWOLF).

Our code is public at\\nhttps://github.com/KarelDO/xmc.dspy.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nExtreme multi-label classification (XMC) tasks are\\nhard to solve with in-context learning alone. Lan-\\nguage models (LMs) might lack prior knowledge\\nabout the precise classes, and the sheer number\\nof available classes—often upwards of 10,000—\\ngenerally means it is infeasible even to demon-\\nstrate every class in a prompt. To deal with this,\\nsome recent efforts make multiple LM calls at in-\\nference time (Zhu and Zamani, 2023), while others\\nprompt LMs to generate synthetic data for finetun-\\ning (Decorte et al., 2023; Clavié and Soulié, 2023).\\nThese methods can be configured to work well,\\nbut they all have manual “knobs” like prompts and\\nother hyperparameters that make applying them to\\nnew datasets, metrics, or LMs challenging.\\nIn this paper, we show that simple programs\\nwritten using the DSPy programming model (Khat-\\ntab et al., 2023) support powerful, highly gen-\\neral approaches to XMC tasks.\\nDSPy allows\\nus to separately specify the modular program\\nof our method and how it should be optimized\\ntowards different datasets.\\nWe propose a sim-\\nple in-context program for XMC tasks called\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank (IReRa, Figure 1, Step 1).\\nFirst, an LM processes the input document and\\nguesses a set of applicable terms (Infer). Then, a\\nretriever relates each predicted term to the actual\\nlabel space (Retrieve). Finally, an LM is used to\\nrerank retrieved labels (Rank). Crucially, we use a\\nfrozen retriever and frozen LMs. The key insights\\nof Infer–Retrieve–Rank is that such a frozen re-\\ntriever can be made much more flexible if the LM\\nlearns in-context how to predict relevant queries\\nand interpret the retrieved results.\\nThe underlying LMs, retriever, and prompts are\\nconsidered hyperparameters of the IReRa program,\\nwhich can be tuned automatically or easily con-\\nfigured. Using only 10 unlabeled training inputs,\\nand ≈50 labeled validation examples, we bootstrap\\na few-shot prompt for our two LM components,\\nusing a zero-shot teacher LM with a minimal seed-\\nprompt (Figure 1, Step 2). DSPy’s compilation ab-\\nstraction handles this nicely; it takes the program\\nlogic we’ve already defined, instantiates it with a\\nteacher LM, processes the unlabeled training ex-\\namples, generates zero-shot labels for each of the\\nprogram steps, and picks the best labels to put in a\\nfew-shot prompt based on validation performance.\\nBecause our program consists of two in-context\\nmodules, we propose to bootstrap them sequen-\\ntially (Figure 1, Step 3).\\nIn our experiments, we instantiate the Infer\\nmodule with a Llama-2-7b-chat model (Touvron\\net al., 2023), while the teacher model used for boot-\\narXiv:2401.12178v1  [cs.CL]  22 Jan 2024\\nFigure 1: We propose Infer-Retrieve-Rank, an efficient in-context learning program for multi-label classification\\nwith an extreme amount of classes (≥10,000). Given an input, a first in-context learning module predicts queries\\nwhich route to a frozen retriever. The retrieved documents are re-ranked by a second in-context module (Step 1).\\nGiven a minimal prompt (Step 2), a zero-shot Teacher LM bootstraps demonstrations to optimize the few-shot\\nStudent LM (Step 3). Optimization using ≈50 labeled inputs can yield state-of-the-art results, using only ≈20\\nTeacher and ≈1,500 Student calls. The (optimization) logic is expressed using the DSPy programming model.\\nstrapping is GPT-3.5. The Rank module is instanti-\\nated and bootstrapped both by a GPT-4 model.\\nAdapting Infer–Retrieve–Rank to a new\\ndataset can be as simple as (i) writing a new mini-\\nmal zero-shot prompt, (ii) configuring which LMs\\nto use, and (iii) running the optimization proce-\\ndure. We optimize this program separately towards\\n4 XMC datasets: one dataset involving the extract-\\ning and coding of adverse drug events expressed in\\nbiomedical literature (BioDEX; D’Oosterlinck et al.\\n2023) and three datasets involving the labeling of\\njob vacancy snippets with the required competen-\\ncies they express (HOUSE, TECH, TECHWOLF;\\nZhang et al. 2022; Decorte et al. 2022, 2023). Our\\nprogram attains state-of-the-art results on the job\\nvacancy datasets, and gets meaningful traction on\\nthe harder biomedical task—without finetuning,\\nwithout prompt engineering, and by using only ≈50\\nlabeled examples. We find that the optimization is\\na consistent driver of performance across tasks.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nThe canonical way of tackling an extreme classi-\\nfication problem involves either finetuning a spe-\\ncialized retriever over the label space or finetuning\\none binary classifier per class (Decorte et al., 2022,\\n2023; Clavié and Soulié, 2023). These methods\\nrequire a lot of data, since every one of the many\\nclasses requires at least a few labeled examples.\\nTo avoid manual data labeling, researchers use dis-\\ntant supervision (Decorte et al., 2022), bootstrap\\nsynthetic data using LLMs (Decorte et al., 2023;\\nClavié and Soulié, 2023; De Raedt et al., 2023), or\\nfinetune retrievers on adjacent problems where data\\nis available (Remy et al., 2022). At inference time,\\nan additional LLM call can be used to rerank a list\\nof generated candidate labels to further increase\\nperformance (Clavié and Soulié, 2023).\\nZhu and Zamani (2023) use multiple GPT-3.5\\ncalls combined with retrieval at inference-time to\\nbootstrap a synthetic prompt per input, infer labels,\\nand rerank them. While they do not use any fine-\\ntuning, they require many LLM and retrieval calls\\nper input. They evaluate on two recommendation\\ntasks, where inputs and outputs are the same type\\nof documents. Bhatia et al. (2016) formulate many\\nrecommendation tasks under the XMC setting. In-\\nstead, we consider XMC tasks where inputs and\\noutputs are not of similar shape, and more inference\\nor information extraction is needed.\\nOur Infer–Retrieve–Rank program does not\\nrely on finetuning or many LLM calls per in-\\nput, making it efficient to develop and deploy.\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank can achieve state-of-the-\\nart performance using only ≈50 labeled examples.\\nUnlike prior work, our program logic is defined\\nin a modular and declarative manner, and can be\\nseamlessly applied to different benchmarks given a\\nminimal seed-prompt. Optimization happens auto-\\nmatically and can resolve in as little as ten minutes.\\nThe choice of LMs and retrievers can be configured,\\nensuring relevance when stronger components be-\\ncome available. Finally, we write at most one seed-\\nprompt per task and in-context module, and let\\noptimization—not iterative prompt engineering—\\ntake care of increasing performance.\\n3\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank\\nThe program for Infer–Retrieve–Rank is given\\nin Code Snippet 1, with minor alterations for\\nbrevity. First, an LM is used to predict queries\\ngiven the input (Infer). The retriever outputs a\\nranking over all labels based on maximum cosine\\nembedding similarity with the queries (Retrieve).\\nThe top labels are reranked by another LM (Rank).\\n1 class InferRetrieveRank(dspy.Module):\\n2\\ndef __init__(self , infer_sig , rank_sig , retr):\\n3\\n# Initialize LM modules with Signatures\\n4\\nself.infer = dspy.ChainOfThought(infer_sig)\\n5\\nself.rank = dspy.ChainOfThrought(rank_sig)\\n6\\nself.retrieve = retr\\n7\\n8\\ndef forward(self , text: str) -> Prediction:\\n9\\n# Predict with LM\\n10\\npreds = self.infer(text).completions.labels\\n11\\n12\\n# Parse LM output\\n13\\npreds = extract_labels_from_strings(preds)\\n14\\n15\\n# Use LM outputs to retrieve labels\\n16\\nlabels = self.retrieve(preds)\\n17\\n18\\n# Use LM to rerank labels\\n19\\nlabels = self.rank(text , labels)\\n20\\n21\\nreturn dspy.Prediction(labels=labels)\\nCode Snippet 1: DSPy code for Infer–Retrieve–Rank\\nwith minor alterations for brevity.\\nNot all labels occur with equal frequency.

Specifically we consider the rank-precision\\nat K (RP@K; defined below). Given a gold num-\\nber of labels Rn for input n, the RP@K measures\\nprecision@K when K ≤Rn and recall@K when\\nK ≥Rn.1 Rel(n, k) = 1 if the k-th output for\\ninput n in the ranking was relevant, else 0.\\nRP@K = 1\\nN\\nN\\n∑\\nn=1\\n1\\nmin(K, Rn)\\nK\\n∑\\nk=1\\nRel(n, k)\\n6\\nData\\nWe evaluate our method and baselines on four ex-\\ntreme classification datasets, one in the biomedical\\nfield and three in the field of human-resources.\\nBioDEX:\\nThe BioDEX dataset (Biomedical\\nDrug Event eXtraction; D’Oosterlinck et al. 2023)\\nconsists of biomedical papers containing various\\ndescriptions of adverse drug events and associated\\nexpert-created labels for the exact type of medi-\\ncal reaction discussed. These events are encoded\\nin the MedDRA ontology (Medical Dictionary for\\nRegulatory Activities; Brown et al. 1999), a set\\nof ≈24,300 standardized medical reaction. Inputs\\ncan be very long (half of inputs have upwards\\nof ≈20,000 characters), and biomedical domain\\nknowledge is needed to infer the correct reactions\\n(not all medical reactions need to be reported, only\\nthe adverse ones). BioDEX models a crucial step\\nin real-world drug safety pipelines. We use a subset\\nof 10 training, 50 validation, and 250 test examples\\nfor our experiments. The median amount of labels\\nper input is 3 while the 95th percentile is 14.\\n1When K = Rn, the precision and the recall of the ranking\\nare by definition equal (Aslam et al., 2005).\\nESCO:\\nThe ESCO ontology (European Commis-\\nsion Directorate-General for Employment, Social\\nAffairs and Inclusion, 2017) contains ≈13,900 dis-\\ntinct concepts used to encode skills, competences,\\nqualifications, and occupations. We consider three\\ndatasets each containing snippets (typically one\\nsentence) of online job vacancies in English with\\ntheir relevant ESCO labels. We use the HOUSE,\\nTECH, and TECHWOLF datasets (Zhang et al.,\\n2022; Decorte et al., 2022, 2023). We take 10\\nexamples each from the HOUSE and TECH valida-\\ntion sets as training examples, and keep the remain-\\ning 51 and 65 examples as validation respectively.\\nTECHWOLF has no validation or training split, so\\nwe use the train and validation split of HOUSE\\ninstead. HOUSE, TECH, and TECHWOLF respec-\\ntively contain 262, 338, and 326 test examples.\\nThe median amount of labels per input across these\\ndatasets is 1 and the 95th percentile is 4.\\n7\\nExperiments and Results\\nTable 1 gives test results for all models and tasks.\\nBaselines\\nWe evaluate a set of baselines across\\nthe four tasks.\\nFirst, we evaluate a ranking\\nequal to the prior statistic over all the labels\\n(prior).\\nFor BioDEX, we estimate these pri-\\nors across all the BioDEX training data.\\nFor\\nthe ESCO datasets, we use the priors distributed\\nby Decorte et al. (2023), which are calculated\\nfrom a private training set. Subsequently we evalu-\\nate the performance of exactly matching the label\\nnames in the input document (exact-match). Fi-\\nnally, we embed the input document with an off-\\nthe-shelf retriever and retrieve over label embed-\\ndings. We use the pre-trained all-mpnet-base-v2\\nmodel (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) for ESCO-\\ntasks and BioLORD (Remy et al., 2022), a biomedi-\\ncal retriever, for BioDEX (naive-retrieve).\\nThrough these baselines, an interesting dis-\\ntinction between BioDEX and the ESCO-tasks\\nemerges. Off-the-shelf retrieval is much stronger\\non ESCO-tasks. We hypothesize this is due to\\nthe shape of the input documents. Entire biomedi-\\ncal publications are hard to compress into a single\\nvector—especially with an off-the-shelf retriever.\\nThe short vacancy snippets are easier to handle.\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank\\nWe\\ninstantiate\\nthe\\nInfer module with a Llama-2-7b-chat stu-\\ndent LM and GPT-3.5-turbo teacher LM.

Infer–Retrieve–Rank can attain state-of-the-art results compared to\\nspecialized systems while requiring no finetuning and multiple orders of magnitude less data. Each program requires\\nan amount of LM calls to bootstrap, which is compared with the training size used by finetuned systems. Best results\\nwithin a 0.5 interval in bold, second best results underlined. The finetuned system results are taken from ♣Decorte\\net al. (2023) and ♢Clavié and Soulié (2023) where available, or adapted from ♡D’Oosterlinck et al. (2023).\\nteacher.\\nThe seed-prompts are given in Code\\nSnippets 2, 3, 4, and 5.\\nWe\\noptimize\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank\\nfor\\nRP@10\\nperformance\\non\\neach\\ndataset\\nsepa-\\nrately. Each run involves 10 unlabeled training\\nexamples and ≈50 labeled validation exam-\\nples.\\nEvery run incurs ≈20 teacher model\\ncalls and ≈1,500 student model calls, and can\\ncomplete in tens of minutes.\\nWe use dspy’s\\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch class to\\nautomate the prompt bootstrapping procedure. A\\ndetailed breakdown of optimization and inference\\ncosts, in function of the different LMs used, is\\ngiven in Section 8. We set the prior hyperparameter\\nA to 0 for ESCO-tasks and 1000 for BioDEX,\\nbased on a handful of validation runs.\\nFor ESCO-tasks, we compare with the best\\nfinetuned systems from the literature. retrieve\\ndenotes the retriever of Decorte et al. (2023),\\nretrieve-rankGPT3.5/4 denotes the system with\\ninference-time reranking of Clavié and Soulié\\n(2023).\\nFor BioDEX, we slightly alter the\\nmethod of D’Oosterlinck et al. (2023): we take\\na FLAN-T5-Large model (Chung et al., 2022) and\\ntrain it to output a comma-separated list of reaction\\nlabels given a chunk of the input paper (the origi-\\nnal BioDEX system was trained to output many at-\\ntributes, of which medical reactions was only one).\\nThis model does not directly produce a ranking, so\\nif a reaction is not predicted we add it in order of\\nthe prior (seq2seq-prior). We also consider sam-\\npling 10 generations from the model and majority\\nvoting the reactions (10×seq2seq-prior).\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-\\nart performance across all ESCO-tasks. Through\\na set of ablations, we find that each optimization\\nstep and module improves performance. Notable,\\nthe Infer-Retrieve system, which ablates the\\nRank module, can still attain competitive results\\ndespite using only one open-source LM and frozen\\nretriever. Infer–Retrieve–Rank does not beat our\\nfinetuned system on BioDEX, but adding a Rank\\nmodule or optimizing Infer consistently improves\\nperformance, indicating that programs can support\\na general approaches to extreme multi-label classi-\\nfication across a variety of datasets with different\\ncharacteristics.\\nConfiguration\\nOptimize Calls\\nCalls / Input\\nLM\\nTeacher\\nLM\\nTeacher\\nLM\\nModules\\nInfer\\nLlama\\nGPT3.5\\n≈500\\n≈10\\n1\\nRetrieve\\nmpnet (or similar)\\nNone\\n0\\n0\\n1\\nRank\\nGPT4\\nGPT4\\n≈500\\n≈10\\n1\\nPrograms\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank\\nLlama-mpnet-GPT4\\nGPT3.5-None-GPT4\\n≈1,500\\n≈20\\n3\\n−optimize Rank\\nLlama-mpnet-GPT4\\nGPT3.5-None\\n≈1,000\\n≈10\\n3\\nInfer-Retrieve\\nLlama-mpnet\\nGPT3.5-None\\n≈1,000\\n≈10\\n2\\n−optimize Infer\\nLlama-mpnet\\nNone-None\\n0\\n0\\n2\\nTable 2: Breakdown of configuration and costs associated with our Modules and Programs. A module is configured\\nwith a single LM and Teacher. A program inherits all LMs of its modules, and all Teachers of its optimized modules.\\nPer module, the optimization procedure requires O(train) Teacher calls and num_programs ⋅O(val) LM calls,\\nwhere num_programs is a hyperparameter controlling how many programs to try during optimization. During\\ninference, 1 LM call is used per module. Programs inherit the optimization calls of their optimized modules, and the\\ninference calls of all modules. While Retrieve is not directly optimized, it does contribute inference calls to the\\noptimization of Infer-Retrieve because the Retrieve module is in the optimization loop. In this work, we use\\n10 training examples, ≈50 validation examples, and set num_programs to 10.\\n8\\nProgram Cost Breakdown\\nTable 2 outlines the optimization and inference\\ncalls associated with our modules and programs.\\nA module is always instantiated with one LM,\\nbut can also have another Teacher LM if it is\\noptimizable.\\nIn our case, the Infer and Rank\\nmodules have a Teacher while Retrieve does\\nnot.\\nOptimizing a module given its inputs in-\\ncurs O(train) calls from the Teacher model and\\nnum_programs ⋅O(validation) calls from the Stu-\\ndent LM, where train and validation denote the\\nsizes of the training and validation sets respectively,\\nand num_programs controls how many different\\nbootstrapped prompts to try in the optimization\\nprocess. In our work, this results in ≈10 Teacher\\nand ≈500 LM calls per module.\\nPrograms inherit the configuration and calls from\\ntheir constituent modules. Teacher optimization\\ncalls are only inherited if the module is actually\\noptimized, LM optimization calls are inherited if\\nthe module is in the loop for another optimized\\nmodule, and inference calls are always inherited.\\nTable 2 makes it easy to express the cost as-\\nsociated with any program.\\nFor example, our\\nstate-of-the-art Infer–Retrieve–Rank program\\nrequires approximately 500 Llama, 500 mpnet, 10\\nGPT3.5, and 510 GPT4 calls to optimize. This is\\ncalculated as follows. First, 500 Llama and 500\\nmpnet student LM calls and 10 GPT3.5 teacher\\ncalls are needed to optimize Infer-Retrieve.\\nThen an additional 500 GPT4 student LM calls\\nand 10 GPT4 teacher calls are needed to optimize\\nRank. Notice how Infer-Retrieve is in the loop\\nwhile Infer–Retrieve–Rank is optimized. Be-\\ncause of the left-to-right nature of this optimiza-\\ntion procedure, we can cache the inference calls of\\nInfer-Retrieve, saving us the cost of executing\\nthem again when optimizing Rank. Per new input,\\nthe program incurs 1 call for each Llama, mpnet,\\nand GPT4 LM.\\nThe finetuned systems we compare to in Table 1\\nall have a much higher start-up cost, in part due to\\nthe need for labeled finetuning data—which some\\nsystems need to bootstrap—and other costs asso-\\nciated with finetuning such as increased hardware\\nrequirements. These finetuned systems can be more\\nefficient per test-time input, given that we currently\\nrely on 2 open-source local calls and 1 closed-\\nsource API call for Infer–Retrieve–Rank. Our\\nInfer-Retrieve program is considerably cheaper\\nto deploy since it relies only on open-source com-\\nponents, while still being competitive. In the fu-\\nture, we plan to use an open-source LM for Rank,\\nmaking our best program considerably cheaper to\\ndeploy as well.\\n9\\nConclusion\\nWe introduced Infer–Retrieve–Rank, a general\\nprogram for extreme multi-label classification.\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank achieves state-of-the-art\\nresults on three benchmarks using one frozen re-\\ntriever combine with two in-context learning mod-\\nules. These findings show that the future of prompt\\nand pipeline engineering need not be brittle. Mod-\\nular programs, once optimized, can serve as highly\\neffective general-purpose solutions.\\nLimitations\\nThe best Infer–Retrieve–Rank program cur-\\nrently requires one GPT-4 call per input document,\\nwhich may not feasible for all applications. In the\\nfuture, we plan to explore more efficient versions\\nof Infer–Retrieve–Rank which rely fully on low-\\ncost open-source components.\\nWhile\\nour\\noptimization\\nprocedure\\nallevi-\\nates the need for iterative prompt engineering,\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank does rely on an initial\\nseed-prompt and performance may vary with spu-\\nrious features of these prompts.\\nIn the future,\\nwe plan to quantify how different optimization\\nprocedures can reduce prompt brittleness, using\\nInfer–Retrieve–Rank and our benchmark suite.\\nEthics Statement\\nWe have applied Infer–Retrieve–Rank to the im-\\nportant real-world tasks of biomedical informa-\\ntion extraction and job vacancy screening. LMs\\nmake mistakes and are biased towards certain pre-\\ndictions (Bender et al., 2021). We advise against\\nthe deployment of Infer–Retrieve–Rank in these\\ncrucial real-world tasks without proper understand-\\ning of the risks involved and how to best measure\\nand mitigate them.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Jens-Joris Decorte and Johannes\\nDeleu for their useful comments, and to Jens-Joris\\nDecorte for providing us with prior statistics on\\nthe ESCO-tasks.

        "The performance of RAG (Retriever-Reader model for open-domain Question Answering) is significantly influenced by the temperature setting. When operating at a low temperature, the model tends to prioritize responses that are closely aligned with its training data and internal probabilities. This often results in concise, factually accurate answers that directly address the given question. Low temperature settings generally lead to more predictable outputs, which can be advantageous when seeking reliable and precise responses. Additionally, these responses are typically well-grounded in the information provided by the model's training data, enhancing their credibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, employing a high temperature setting encourages the model to explore a broader range of possibilities, potentially generating more diverse and creative responses. While this can lead to more interesting and novel answers, it may also result in less coherent and relevant outputs. High temperature settings can introduce more variability into the responses, which might be beneficial in certain contexts where creativity and exploration are valued over precision.\n",
